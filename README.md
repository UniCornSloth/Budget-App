# Budget-App
This is a budgeting app project I am working on.
It will be a basic budget application wich will start of with a USER REGISTRATION and LOGIN.
Once the user has logged in, a OVERVIEW of logged in USER will be displayed. On this page You will be able to view all your details on Your budgeting account that you have set up.
The user will have the choice and selection of where the income goes to. Seperate sections and options will be provided. 
- INCOME
- MONEY OUT
- MAIN EXPENDITURES

The user will be able to use this app in everyday day to day planning. For a simple way to plan and update Private budget. 


It is my first propper planning and setting up the app. Will be working on this in a day to day basis allong with a lot of studying as well. Any comments and help will be greatly appreciated.
